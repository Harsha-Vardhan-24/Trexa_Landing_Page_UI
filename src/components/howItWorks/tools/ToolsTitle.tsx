        Exam.net has an integrated set of tools to enrich and simplify the exam
        experience. The teacher chooses which of these tools are available to
        students during an exam. Teachers can always upload their own resources,
        such as a poem, a reading, an image, a periodic table, a list of
        equations or an audio recording to be available during the exam.
